	<p>Hello! I'm Rebecca Bulla. I was born and raised in Amarillo (with a degree in LBK thrown in there), until I hit my mid-20's and decided to move to NYC. I dabbled in survival jobs, Shakespeare, and a casting internship for Broadway. Moved back in 2015 to marry my husband, Blaze. Saved up and returned to NYC -- he got a job with a start-up and I was looking to start a bootcamp. I got really sick...okay, turned out I was pregnant! So we moved home and started a family. I've got three awesome boys, Ollie, Winston, and a dog named Hot Shot. 6 years later, I'm finally getting to try again at this career field!</p>
